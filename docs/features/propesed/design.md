 # Proposed Features
  
 This document contains the following proposed features for the web interface:

- Campaign Folders: The folder provides a way for the user to organise their links for their various campaigns. The number of expired and functional links allow the user to get an overview of the project without opening the folder.
- Expiry Status Icon: The expiry status icon in is a timer to portray that all links are temporary and will one day expire. The color red shows urgency in case the user forgot to update the expiry date of a link.
- Link Expiry Editor: The link expiry editor allows the user to view or edit the link expiry date. If the link is expired it shows up in red along with a blank textbox, however if it is functional it shows up in green with the expiry date given.

The figma designs of the above features can be found here:
