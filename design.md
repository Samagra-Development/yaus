#### Expiry Status

The expiry status icon portrays that the link is temporary and will expire. The color red shows urgency in case the user forgot to update the expiry date of a link.

#### Link Expiry Editor

The link expiry editor allows the user to view or edit the link expiry date. If the link is expired it shows up in red along with a blank textbox, however if it is functional it shows up in green with the expiry date given.

#### Campaign Folders

The folder provides a way for the user to organise their links for their various campaigns. The number of expired and functional links allow the user to get an overview of the project without opening the folder.
